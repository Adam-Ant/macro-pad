# Macro Pad
A project for designing a macro pad to allow complex functions to be mapped to dedicated buttons, using the low cost Arduino Pro Micro. The pad functions by using the inbuilt features of the ATMega32u4 used on the Pro Micro to emulate a gamepad, allowing the buttons to be mapped to many functions. Also includes compatibilty with LED backlighting, including brightness control.

## Parts included:
1. PCB and Schematic in Eagle format and as basic images
2. Firmware for configuring the board to appear as a series of joystick buttons. This is to improve compatibility accross operating systems and programs
3. Case: An example laser cut case for the board. Overview is a general overview of the pieces of the board and assemblly order, Laid out is the pieces optimized for laser cutting.
